## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

For the weekend salary calculator our goal was to create a form that accepted new employees to be added to an employee table.
Using these employees I calculated the total monthly salaries using simple math. The way I solved this was by using the a similar process 
shown in class. After filling out basic HTML elements I would add an event listener, then I would update the state of given variables in JS.
Using these variables I could update the DOM using a render function inside of my JS.
